          The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball
          league in North America.
          <br />
          The league is composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in
          Canada) and is one of the four major professional sports leagues in
          the United States and Canada. <br />
          It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.
          The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the
          Basketball Association of America (BAA). <br />
          It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August
          3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League
          (NBL). <br />
          The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team
          playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June.
          <br />
          As of 2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average
          annual salary per player.

          After four seasons with the Miami Heat, LeBron James returned to the
          Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2014–15 season.
          <br />
          He led the team to their second Finals appearance with the help of
          Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love.
          <br />
          The Golden State Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, led by
          the "Splash Brothers" Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. <br />
          The Cavaliers and the Warriors faced each other in the Finals a record
          four consecutive times. In the 2015–16 season, <br />
          the Warriors finished the season 73–9, the best season record in NBA
          history. However, the Cavaliers overcame a 3–1 deficit in the Finals
          to win their first championship that season. <br />
          In the 2016–17 season, the Warriors benefited from the recruitment of
          free agent Kevin Durant. The Warriors won the 2017 and 2018 Finals
          against the Cavaliers.
